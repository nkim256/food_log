Preliminary Ideas/ Things I want to track:

# Phases

## Phase 1
- Get Django side working
- Create necessary models and a sane data representation of foods/recipes

## Phase 2
- Get some front end working
- Some functionality working

## Phase 3
- Connect to Heroku

## Phase 4
- Show trends and cool stuff

Calorie Intake
- Create certain foods and be able to track by weight, or different servings
- Create recipes
- Save foods
- Maybe connect to MyFitnessPal??
